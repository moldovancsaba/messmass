**Admin users only** can generate shareable links:

2. Find your event
3. Click "Share" button
4. System generates:
   - **Stats Link**: View-only statistics page

### Sharing Best Practices

**DO**:
- Share link + password separately (e.g., link via email, password via SMS)
- Set expiration dates for sensitive events
- Track who has access (keep a list)
- Regenerate passwords if compromised

**DON'T**:
- Post passwords in public channels (Slack, Teams without encryption)
- Share edit access unless absolutely necessary
- Use the same password for multiple events

### Revoking Access

Currently, access revocation requires admin assistance:
1. Contact your system administrator
2. Request password regeneration for the event
3. New password invalidates old links
4. Re-share updated password with authorized users only

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Hashtag System

### Traditional Hashtags

Simple tags without categories:
- Example: `#summer`, `#budapest`, `#festival`
- Appear as colored bubbles
- Colors assigned by admin
- Click to filter events with same hashtag

### Category-Prefixed Hashtags

Organized tags with structure:
- Format: `category:hashtag`
- Example: `country:hungary`, `period:summer`, `success:approved`
- Display with category prefix in lighter text
- Inherit category color

**Why use categories?**:
- Better organization (all countries grouped together)
- Precise filtering (find all "country" tags vs. generic search)
- Clearer reporting

### Color Coding

- Each hashtag category has its own color
- Individual hashtags can have custom colors
- Helps visual scanning across multiple events
