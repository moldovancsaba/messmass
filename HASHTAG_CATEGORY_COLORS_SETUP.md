# Hashtag Category Colors Setup Guide

## 🎨 Problem

When you have hashtags in a category like `partner:mkosz`, but the hashtags are **not displaying in the category's color**, it means the **category doesn't exist** in the hashtag categories database.

## ✅ Solution: Create the Category

To make partner hashtags (or any category hashtags) display in the correct color:

### Step 1: Go to Hashtag Categories Admin

Visit: **https://www.messmass.com/admin/categories**

### Step 2: Create the "partner" Category

1. Click **"+ New Category"** button
2. Enter the category name: `partner`
3. Choose a color for partner hashtags (e.g., `#FFA500` for orange, or any color you prefer)
4. Click **"Create Category"**

### Step 3: Verify It Works

1. Go to **Projects Management** page
2. Look at projects that have partner hashtags
3. The partner hashtags should now display in the color you assigned

## 🔧 How the Color System Works

1. **Category Color** (Highest Priority)
   - If a hashtag is in `categorizedHashtags.partner = ["mkosz"]`
   - And category "partner" exists with color `#FF8C00`
   - Then `#partner:mkosz` displays in orange

2. **Individual Hashtag Color** (Medium Priority)
   - If a hashtag has its own color set in Hashtag Manager
   - That color is used if no category exists

3. **Default Color** (Lowest Priority)
   - If neither category nor individual color exists
   - Default purple `#667eea` is used

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Hashtags still showing in default purple color

**Causes:**
1. Category not created yet → Create it
2. Category name mismatch → Check spelling (must match exactly)
3. Browser cache → Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5)
4. Hashtag in wrong field → Should be in `categorizedHashtags.partner[]`, not just `hashtags[]`

### Issue: Can't create category

**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as admin and have permissions.

### Issue: Color not updating

**Solution:** 
1. Hard refresh browser
2. Check category color was saved correctly
3. Verify the hashtag is actually in that category in the project data
