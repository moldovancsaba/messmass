**Last Updated:** 2025-10-13T09:30:00.000Z  
**Version:** 5.51.1

## üéØ What This Does

Connects your Bitly shortened links to your MessMass events to track:
- **Click statistics** (how many people clicked your links)
- **Geographic data** (which countries your clicks come from)
- **Traffic sources** (where people found your links - social media, email, etc.)
- **Campaign performance** (UTM tracking for marketing campaigns)

## üöÄ How to Use It

### Step 1: Access the Admin Panel

1. Go to your MessMass admin panel
2. Log in with your admin credentials
3. Navigate to **Admin ‚Üí Bitly** in the menu

### Step 2: Add a Bitly Link

1. Click the **"+ Add Link"** button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Bitly Link or URL** (required): 
     - You can paste either:
       - A Bitly short link: `bit.ly/abc123`
       - A full Bitly URL: `https://bit.ly/abc123`
       - The original long URL
   - **Assign to Project** (optional):
     - Select an event from the dropdown
     - Or leave it unassigned to add it later
   - **Custom Title** (optional):
     - Add a friendly name
     - If empty, uses Bitly's title
3. Click **"Add Link"**

### Step 3: Manage Links

**View All Links:**
- The table shows all your Bitly links
- See click counts, sync status, and assignments

**Reassign a Link:**
- Use the dropdown in the "Project" column
- Select a different event to move the link
- Or select "-- Unassigned --" to unassign it

**Remove a Link:**
- Click the üóëÔ∏è (trash) icon
- Confirms before archiving
- Data is preserved but link becomes hidden

### Step 4: Refresh Analytics

**Automatic Sync:**
- Happens every night at 3:00 AM UTC
- No action needed - runs automatically

**Manual Sync:**
- Click the **"üîÑ Sync Now"** button
- Updates all links immediately
- Takes about 1 minute

## üìä View Analytics

Once links are synced, analytics will show:
- **Total Clicks**: In the "Clicks" column
- **Last Synced**: When data was last updated
- **Detailed Analytics**: *(Coming soon in project stats pages)*

## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Q: What happens when I add a link?
**A:** The system fetches the link's information from Bitly and stores it. The first sync happens automatically at night, or you can click "Sync Now" for immediate data.

### Q: Can I connect multiple Bitly links to one event?
**A:** Yes! One event can have many Bitly links associated with it.

### Q: Can I move a link between events?
**A:** Yes! Just use the dropdown in the "Project" column to reassign it.

### Q: What if I enter the wrong link?
**A:** You can archive it (üóëÔ∏è button) and add the correct one. Archived links don't sync but data is kept.

### Q: How often does data update?
**A:** Automatically every night at 3:00 AM UTC, or click "Sync Now" anytime for immediate refresh.

### Q: Do I need to do anything after adding a link?
**A:** No! After you add it, the system automatically:
- Syncs data every night
- Tracks all clicks
- Updates analytics
- Stores geographic and referrer information
