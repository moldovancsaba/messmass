## 🔗 Key Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 1:** None (foundational)
- **Phase 2:** Phase 1 complete (aggregated data required)
- **Phase 3:** Phases 1-2 complete (data + insights)
- **Phase 4:** Phases 1-3 complete (data + dashboards)
- **Phase 5:** Phases 1-4 complete (all features)

### Data Dependencies
- **Minimum 6 months:** Historical data for trend analysis
- **Bitly integration:** Required for 25 Bitly-based charts
- **Partner system:** Required for team/league comparisons
- **Hashtag categories:** Required for category-based analytics

### Technical Dependencies
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Cloud database (already in use)
- **Next.js 15:** App Router with Server Components
- **WebSocket server:** Real-time updates (already running)
- **CSS Modules + theme.css:** Styling system (already implemented)

---

## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

### 1. MongoDB Aggregation Strategy
**Decision:** Pre-compute metrics via background jobs every 5 minutes  
**Rationale:** Achieve <500ms query response for 1-year datasets  
**Alternative Rejected:** Real-time calculations (too slow for complex queries)

### 2. Rule-Based Insights Engine
**Decision:** Use threshold-based rules for MVP  
**Rationale:** Faster to implement, explainable, no ML training required  
**Alternative Rejected:** Machine learning models (overkill for MVP, black box)

### 3. Puppeteer for PDF Generation
**Decision:** Use Puppeteer to render HTML/CSS to PDF  
**Rationale:** Full styling control, supports charts as images  
**Alternative Rejected:** jsPDF (limited layout flexibility)

### 4. WebSocket for Real-Time Updates
**Decision:** Extend existing WebSocket server with dashboard channels  
**Rationale:** Existing infrastructure, proven reliability  
**Alternative Rejected:** Server-Sent Events (one-way only)

### 5. Custom Dashboard Builder
**Decision:** Build in-house with drag-and-drop  
**Rationale:** Full control, no third-party licensing  
**Alternative Rejected:** Embedded BI tools (expensive, vendor lock-in)

### 6. Scheduled Email Reports
**Decision:** Use SendGrid or AWS SES with hourly cron  
**Rationale:** Reliable delivery, tracking, reasonable cost  
**Alternative Rejected:** Self-hosted SMTP (deliverability issues)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk:** Aggregation job exceeds 5-minute window  
  **Mitigation:** Batch processing, optimize queries, add indexes
  
- **Risk:** Dashboard load time >3 seconds  
  **Mitigation:** Lazy loading, caching, code splitting

### Data Quality Risks
- **Risk:** Incomplete historical data  
  **Mitigation:** Backfill script with validation, manual review
  
- **Risk:** Aggregation calculation errors  
  **Mitigation:** Unit tests for formulas, comparison to manual calcs

### User Adoption Risks
- **Risk:** Dashboards too complex  
  **Mitigation:** Pre-built templates, video training, in-app help
  
- **Risk:** Insights not actionable  
  **Mitigation:** Iterate based on feedback, refine rules

### Technical Risks
- **Risk:** WebSocket connection drops  
  **Mitigation:** Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
  
- **Risk:** PDF generation fails  
  **Mitigation:** Retry logic, fallback to CSV export
