## Version 2.2.0 - Hashtag Categories System
*Target Release: 2025-01-28*

### Overview
Implementation of hashtag categories system to organize project hashtags into custom groups (e.g., city, vetting, success, year) with category-specific styling and enhanced user interface.

### Key Features

#### üè∑Ô∏è Hashtag Categories Management
- **Admin Hashtag Manager Page**: New dedicated page at `/admin/hashtags` (moved from embedded toggle in AdminDashboard)
- **Category CRUD Operations**: Create, edit, delete, and reorder custom categories

- **Default Hashtag Section**: Preserve existing "Add hashtags to categorize this project..." input
- **Dynamic Category Sections**: Each custom category displays as "CategoryName [existing tags] [+ add input]"
- **Category Color Application**: Hashtags display in their category's color when assigned to a category
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly category management interface

#### üëÄ View More Functionality
- **Aggregated Statistics**: Limit initial display to top 10 hashtags, expandable with "View More" button
- **Project Management Table**: Add pagination/lazy loading for large project lists
- **Smooth Animations**: Expand/collapse animations for better user experience

#### üíæ Data Architecture
- **New Collection**: `hashtag_categories` with name, color, order, timestamps
