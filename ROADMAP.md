## üîß Operational Initiatives

### Style System Hardening (Q1 2026)
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Active - Phase 1  
**Dependencies**: Design tokens (theme.css), CSS Modules

- **Phase 2**: Systematic refactoring of all components with inline styles
- **Phase 3**: Create reusable CSS modules for common layouts
- **Phase 4**: Add ESLint rule to prevent inline styles
- **Phase 5**: Consolidate duplicated CSS files
- **Phase 6**: Prepare Atlas-managed theme injection plan

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Zero inline styles (except computed token-driven styles)
- All layouts use design tokens from theme.css
- ESLint enforcement active
- Visual regression: zero changes to UI appearance
