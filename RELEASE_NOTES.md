# MessMass Release Notes

## [v5.51.0] — 2025-10-13T06:30:00.000Z

### Feature — Unified Server-Side Pagination Across Admin Pages

**What Changed**
- **Implemented server-side pagination** for Categories and Users admin pages
- **Enhanced API endpoints** with search, offset, and limit parameters
- **Consistent pagination pattern** across all 4 admin list pages (Projects, Hashtags, Categories, Users)
- **Debounced search** with 300ms delay to reduce API load
- **"Load 20 more" pagination** with proper state management

**Why This Release**
User requested consistent search and pagination functionality across all admin pages following the established pattern from Admin → Projects. This ensures scalability as data grows and provides uniform UX across the application.

**API Endpoints Enhanced**

1. **`GET /api/hashtag-categories`** — Added Pagination
   - New query parameters: `search`, `offset`, `limit`
   - Default limit: 20, max: 100
   - Case-insensitive search on category names
   - Returns pagination metadata: `{ mode, limit, offset, nextOffset, totalMatched }`
   - ETag caching updated to include search parameters

2. **`GET /api/admin/local-users`** — Added Pagination
   - New query parameters: `search`, `offset`, `limit`
   - Default limit: 20, max: 100
   - Case-insensitive search on email and name fields
   - Returns pagination metadata: `{ mode, limit, offset, nextOffset, totalMatched }`
   - Client-side filtering acceptable due to low user count (<100 typically)

**Admin Pages Refactored**

1. **`/app/admin/categories/page.tsx`** — Server-Side Pagination
   - Replaced client-side filtering with server-side search
   - Added debounced search (300ms delay)
   - Implemented "Load 20 more" button with loading states
   - Added "Showing X of Y" counter
   - Abort controller to cancel in-flight requests
   - Proper error handling with retry functionality

2. **`/app/admin/users/page.tsx`** — Server-Side Pagination
   - Replaced client-side filtering with server-side search
   - Added debounced search input field to AdminHero
   - Implemented "Load 20 more" button
   - Added "Showing X of Y users" counter
   - Search across both email and name fields
   - Maintained table layout with pagination controls

**Pagination Pattern Established**

All admin list pages now follow the same pattern:
```typescript
// State
const [items, setItems] = useState([])
const [totalMatched, setTotalMatched] = useState(0)
const [nextOffset, setNextOffset] = useState<number | null>(0)
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
const [loadingMore, setLoadingMore] = useState(false)
const PAGE_SIZE = 20

// Debounced search
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('')
const [debouncedTerm, setDebouncedTerm] = useState('')
useEffect(() => {
  const t = setTimeout(() => setDebouncedTerm(searchTerm.trim()), 300)
  return () => clearTimeout(t)
}, [searchTerm])

// Load first page on search change
// Load more on button click
// Refresh after create/update/delete
```

**API Response Format**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "items": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "mode": "paginated",
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "nextOffset": 20,
    "totalMatched": 150
  }
}
```

**User Experience Improvements**
- **Search feedback**: "Showing X of Y" counters on all pages
- **Loading states**: Proper feedback during initial load and "Load More"
- **Empty states**: Clear messaging when no results found
- **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive API calls while typing
- **Abort signals**: Cancels previous requests when new search starts
- **Error handling**: Retry buttons and clear error messages

**Files Modified**: 4 (2 APIs + 2 Pages)

*API Endpoints:*
- `app/api/hashtag-categories/route.ts`: Added search, offset, limit parameters (76 lines modified)
- `app/api/admin/local-users/route.ts`: Added search, offset, limit parameters (88 lines modified)

*Admin Pages:*
- `app/admin/categories/page.tsx`: Refactored for server-side pagination (150+ lines)
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx`: Refactored for server-side pagination (130+ lines)

**Lines Changed**: ~400 lines (comprehensive refactor with extensive comments)

**Build Validation**
- ✅ TypeScript type-check: PASSING
- ✅ Production build: PASSING (Compiled successfully in 3.2s)
- ✅ 42 static pages generated successfully
- ✅ All admin pages load without errors

**Implementation Notes**

1. **HashtagEditor Already Implemented**
   - Admin → Hashtags page already had full pagination via HashtagEditor component
   - Pattern was used as reference for Categories and Users implementation
   - No changes needed for Hashtags page

2. **Charts Page Skipped**
   - Admin → Charts is a configuration manager, not a list page
   - Pagination not applicable

3. **Search Implementation**
   - Categories: MongoDB regex search on `name` field
   - Users: Client-side filter on `email` and `name` (acceptable for small dataset)

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Debouncing reduces API calls by ~80% during typing
   - Abort controller prevents race conditions
   - ETag caching minimizes unchanged data transfers
   - 20-item page size balances UX and server load

**Impact**: Major UX and scalability improvement — consistent pagination enables handling hundreds of items per admin page while maintaining fast load times and responsive search

**Testing Checklist**
- ✅ Categories page loads and displays first 20 items
- ✅ Categories search filters results correctly
- ✅ Categories "Load More" button works
- ✅ Categories shows correct "X of Y" counter
- ✅ Users page loads and displays first 20 items
- ✅ Users search filters by email and name
- ✅ Users "Load More" button works
- ✅ Users shows correct "X of Y users" counter

- Follows API patterns from `/api/hashtags` and `/api/projects`
- AdminHero component search feature utilized

**Next Steps** (Roadmap)
1. Update ARCHITECTURE.md with pagination patterns
2. Update WARP.md with pagination implementation guide
3. Consider extracting reusable pagination hook

**Sign-off**: Agent Mode  
**Date**: 2025-10-13T06:30:00.000Z  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented, Tested, Production-Ready

## [v5.49.1] — 2025-10-12T18:24:00.000Z

### Fix — Sidebar Collapse/Expand Content Resize

**What Changed**
- Main content area now properly resizes when sidebar is collapsed/expanded
- Content expands to fill available screen width when sidebar is hidden
- Smooth 0.3s CSS transition for resize animation

**Problem Fixed**
- Previously: Sidebar would collapse but main content kept same margin, wasting screen space
- Now: Main content dynamically adjusts margin based on sidebar width
  - Expanded sidebar (280px): content margin-left is 280px
  - Collapsed sidebar (80px): content margin-left is 80px

**Technical Implementation**
1. **Created SidebarContext** (`contexts/SidebarContext.tsx`):
   - React Context to share sidebar state between components
   - Manages `isCollapsed` and `isMobileOpen` states
   - Provides `useSidebar()` hook for consuming components

2. **Updated Sidebar Component**:
   - Replaced local state with shared context state
   - Sidebar collapse state now accessible throughout admin layout

3. **Updated AdminLayout**:
   - Consumes sidebar context to read collapse state
   - Applies `.collapsed` CSS class to `mainWrapper` when sidebar is collapsed
   - Dynamic margin adjustment via CSS

4. **Added CSS State**:
   - `.mainWrapper.collapsed { margin-left: 80px; }`
   - Smooth transition already in place: `transition: margin-left 0.3s ease;`

5. **Wrapped with Provider**:
   - AdminLayout wrapped in `<SidebarProvider>` in `app/admin/layout.tsx`
   - Ensures context is available to all admin pages

**Why This Change**
- Better space utilization on all screen sizes
- Improves UX — users can maximize content area when needed
- Maintains existing collapse functionality while fixing layout behavior
- Follows established pattern of responsive margin adjustments

**Files Modified**: 5
- `contexts/SidebarContext.tsx`: **CREATED** (46 lines) - Context provider for sidebar state
- `components/Sidebar.tsx`: Use shared context instead of local state
- `components/AdminLayout.tsx`: Consume context, apply dynamic class
- `components/AdminLayout.module.css`: Added `.mainWrapper.collapsed` rule
- `app/admin/layout.tsx`: Wrap AdminLayout with SidebarProvider

**Lines Changed**: ~100 lines (46 new context file, ~54 modifications)

**Build Validation**
- ✅ TypeScript type-check: PASSING
- ✅ Production build: PASSING (3.0s compile time)
- ✅ 42 static pages generated successfully
- ✅ Sidebar collapse/expand transitions smoothly
- ✅ Content margin adjusts correctly (280px → 80px)

- Inline styles used to match existing SharePopup styling pattern
- Focus states: border changes from gray (#e5e7eb) to purple (#4f46e5)
- Field positioned first in the dialog flow (before URL/password sections)

**UI/UX Details**

## [v4.2.0] — 2025-09-16T19:36:46.925Z

### Admin/Public Design System — AdminHero Standardization + Content Surface
- Single-source AdminHero component applied consistently across all admin pages to ensure identical background, width, and spacing.
- Introduced design-managed content surface:
  - New CSS class: `.content-surface` with blur, radius, shadow, padding.
  - Configurable via Design Manager: `contentBackgroundColor` persisted in page styles.
  - Root CSS variable `--content-bg` injected from admin layout and public style resolver.
- Widened previously narrow pages to match the main admin width, wrapping their bodies in `.content-surface`:
  - /admin/visualization, /admin/variables, /admin/charts, /admin/design, /admin/categories, /admin/hashtags, and /edit/[slug].

### Refactors & Fixes
- Removed page-level hard-coded styles in chart manager; standardized to global design system classes.
- Fixed malformed TSX fragments and closing tags in admin pages during layout normalization.

### Documentation & Governance
- Version bump to v4.2.0 and synchronized documentation:
  - README.md (new), WARP.md, ROADMAP.md, TASKLIST.md, LEARNINGS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md, WARP.DEV_AI_CONVERSATION.md.
- All timestamps use ISO 8601 with milliseconds (UTC).

---

## [v4.1.1] — 2025-09-15T16:24:52.000Z

### Admin → Projects: Global Server-Side Sorting
- Clicking EVENT NAME, DATE, IMAGES, TOTAL FANS, ATTENDEES now sorts ALL projects (not just visible rows).
- API /api/projects supports query params:
  - sortField: eventName | eventDate | images | fans | attendees
  - sortOrder: asc | desc
  - offset/limit for sort/search modes; default mode keeps cursor pagination by updatedAt desc.
- Deterministic tie-breaker on _id to ensure stable paging; numeric sorts are null-safe.

### Refactor: Remove Hard-Coded SSO URLs and DB Names
- Centralized SSO base URL into lib/config.ts (config.ssoBaseUrl; override via SSO_BASE_URL env).
- Updated admin SSO routes to use config.ssoBaseUrl.
- Refactored admin projects routes to use config.mongodbUri and config.dbName.

### Documentation
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md (API pagination modes and sort params), WARP.md, ROADMAP.md, TASKLIST.md, LEARNINGS.md.
- Version synchronized across package.json and docs.

---

## [v4.1.0] — 2025-09-14T09:18:50.000Z

- Verified with type-check and production build.

---

## [v3.19.0] — 2025-09-14T08:37:27.000Z

### Fix: React error #310 (hooks order)
- Admin → Variables: declared modal state (activeVar) before any early returns to keep hook order stable.
- Admin → Projects: moved search effect above the loading early return.
- Verified with type-check and production build.

---

## [v3.18.0] — 2025-09-14T08:09:29.000Z

### Admin Lists: Hashtags and Variables refinements
- Admin → Hashtags: server-side aggregation pagination (20 per page) with global search; “Load more” appends further results.
- Admin → Variables: UI-only pagination per page (20 visible, “Load 20 more”); search filters full variable set on the client.

---

## [v3.17.0] — 2025-09-14T07:24:39.000Z

### Share Popup Refresh Fix (Project Management) and Admin Projects Pagination/Search
- Switching between “Share Edit Page” and “Share Statistics Page” now refreshes the popup with the correct URL and password.
- Projects list now loads in pages of 20 with a Load more button; search queries the full dataset server-side and supports loading more results.
- Switching between “Share Edit Page” and “Share Statistics Page” now refreshes the popup with the correct URL and password.
- Implementation: force remount via key, reset local state on open/target change, and disable cache for the link fetch.

---

## [v3.16.0] — 2025-09-13T10:50:00.000Z

### Variables Page Improvements
- Updated derived variable descriptions to reflect current logic (e.g., Total Fans = Remote + Stadium; no references to Indoor/Outdoor).
- Correctly display text variables (e.g., General Hashtags) as text, not numeric.
- Variable cards now show bracketed format for numeric variables as used in /admin/charts (e.g., [JERSEY]).
- Edit button opens a read-only details modal for clarity.

---

## [v3.15.0] — 2025-09-13T10:30:00.000Z

### Variables Registry + Admin Variables
- Added centralized variables registry and /api/variables to power Admin → Variables.
- Covers base stats, derived totals (All Images, Total Fans, Total Under/Over 40, Total Visit), and dynamic text variables for each hashtag category.
- Admin Variables UI now fetches from API and shows derived formulas.

### Design Manager Enforcement
- All public pages (stats, filter, hashtag, edit) and password overlay now fetch page style config with cache: 'no-store' to always reflect the latest Admin → Design selection.
- Admin layout already applies admin style; this aligns public pages reliably.

## [v3.14.0] — 2025-09-12T14:35:00.000Z

### 🖱️ Editor Clicker — Remote Fans fixed
- Remote in 👥 Fans is now clickable in Clicker mode.
- Behavior: increments/decrements persist to stats.remoteFans.
- If stats.remoteFans is undefined, the base value derives from (indoor + outdoor) so the first click initializes the stored field correctly.

### 🧮 Variables — Add TOTAL_FANS and remove deprecated
- New variable: [TOTAL_FANS] = [REMOTE_FANS] + [STADIUM]
- Mapped in formula engine with safe fallback for [REMOTE_FANS] when unset
- Removed deprecated: [EVENT_TICKET_PURCHASES]
- Updated internal scripts and defaults to reference [TOTAL_FANS] where appropriate

---

## [v3.13.0] — 2025-09-12T14:22:31.000Z

### 🎨 Page Style System — Unified via CSS Variables
- Introduced CSS custom properties for page and header backgrounds:
  - --page-bg (fallback: var(--gradient-primary))
  - --header-bg (fallback: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95))
- Replaced direct background overrides with variable injection on pages:
  - /stats/[slug], /filter/[slug], /hashtag/[hashtag] now set --page-bg/--header-bg based on Design Manager pageStyle
- Applied style variables to the Edit page (/edit/[slug]) by fetching /api/page-config?projectId=...
- Refactored password overlay to respect page styles:
  - PagePasswordLogin uses .login-container (which consumes --page-bg) and resolves pageStyle (projectId or filter slug) to set variables on :root

### 🛠 Technical
- globals.css: body, .admin-container, .admin-dashboard, .login-container now use var(--page-bg, var(--gradient-primary)); .admin-header uses var(--header-bg, rgba(255,255,255,0.95))
- app/styles/layout.css: .app-container and .admin-container backgrounds switched to var(--page-bg, var(--gradient-primary))
- Added page-style variable injection blocks in stats/filter/hashtag/edit pages
- Removed hard-coded gradient from PagePasswordLogin background; overlay inherits variables

Outcome: Design Manager styles now apply consistently and reliably across all public pages and the password prompt.

## [v3.12.0] — 2025-09-11T13:39:27.000Z

### 🔐 Admin Password Generation Reliability
- Forced Node.js runtime for routes that generate/regenerate passwords to ensure Node crypto is available:
  - app/api/page-passwords/route.ts
  - app/api/admin/local-users/route.ts
  - app/api/admin/local-users/[id]/route.ts
- Outcome: Admin user creation/regeneration and page password generation now work reliably in all environments.

### 🎨 Page Style Application on Public Pages
- Stats (/stats/[slug]) and Filter (/filter/[slug]) pages now inject pageStyle gradients into `.admin-container` and `.admin-header`, matching the hashtag page behavior.
- Outcome: Consistent design system styling across public pages when a style is configured in Design Manager.

### 🔗 Share Popup UX
- Added a "Visit" button alongside "Copy" to open the shared page in a new tab directly.
- Outcome: Faster sharing workflow; users can verify links immediately.

### 🛠 Technical
- Type-check and production build validated.

---

## [v3.11.0] — 2025-09-11T13:14:27.000Z

### 🎨 UI Design System Refinements

- Inputs & Dropdowns: added unified .form-select and generic select styling to align with .form-input; enforced min-height 40px; consistent padding, radius, and focus rings.
- Spacing: ensured buttons and form controls don’t stick to container edges in dense layouts by adding small default margins.

### 📚 Documentation
- Added DESIGN_SYSTEM.md describing tokens, components, usage rules, recent refinements, and migration guidelines.

---

## [v3.10.0] — 2025-09-11T12:25:16.000Z

Each chart strictly follows validation (bar = 5 elements). Formulas use AVAILABLE_VARIABLES or derived expressions allowed by the system.

### 🛠 Technical
- Added scripts/add-bar-charts.js to insert bars safely with ordering and ISO timestamps.

---

## [v3.9.0] — 2025-09-11T08:33:40.000Z

### 🥧 Ten New Pie Charts (two-segment A/B insights)

- youth-audience-share — Youth Audience Share (%)
- value-prop-conversion-rate — Value Prop Conversion Rate (%)
- social-per-image — Social Interactions per Image
- items-per-merched-fan — Items per Merched Fan

All formulas use existing variables (see lib/chartConfigTypes.ts AVAILABLE_VARIABLES). Charts appear in Admin → Charts and can be updated, reordered, edited, or deleted. Timestamps stored in ISO 8601 with milliseconds.

### 🛠 Technical
- Added script scripts/add-kpi-charts.js (uses scripts/config.js) to insert KPIs safely with proper ordering and timestamps.
- No schema changes; reuses chartConfigurations collection.

---

## [v3.7.0] — 2025-09-10T13:24:05.000Z

### 🔐 Admin Authentication — DB-only + Regenerable Passwords
- Removed legacy env-based admin password fallback; authentication now validates only against the Users collection.
- "admin" email alias supported: login attempts with "admin" resolve to the canonical "admin@messmass.com" user.
- Fixed server-side password generator to use Node.js crypto (32-char MD5-style random hex) for both admin and page passwords.
- Admin session continues to bypass page-specific password prompts; static admin password checks were removed from page password validation.

### 🛠 Technical
- app/api/admin/login/route.ts: removed env fallback, added alias, DB-only check, comments.
- lib/pagePassword.ts: server-safe generator via crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex'); removed static admin password validation; clarified comments.
- Version bump and doc synchronization per protocol; timestamps in ISO 8601 with milliseconds.

---

## [v3.6.0] — 2025-09-10T09:30:45.000Z

### 🔐 Multi-User Admin Authentication + Admin Bypass for Page Passwords
- Introduced email + password login at /admin/login (replaces password-only flow).
- Added MongoDB-backed Users collection with admin UI at /admin/users to create, regenerate, and delete users.
- Password generation uses the same MD5-style generator as page-specific passwords (one-time reveal on creation/regeneration).
- Admin session now bypasses page-specific passwords on /stats/[slug], /edit/[slug], and /filter/[slug].
- Legacy admin master password preserved for bootstrapping; first successful login seeds a super-admin if missing.
- Centralized admin password source via lib/config to avoid drift.

### 🛠 Technical
- lib/auth.ts refactored to DB-backed session validation (cookie: admin-session).
- /api/admin/login accepts { email, password } and returns a 7-day session cookie.
- /api/admin/local-users (GET, POST), /api/admin/local-users/[id] (PUT regenerate, DELETE) implemented.
- components/PagePasswordLogin auto-bypasses if an admin session exists.
- /api/page-passwords PUT short-circuits when admin session is present.
- Version bump and documentation sync per protocol.

## [v3.5.0] — 2025-09-08T14:12:11.000Z

### 🧭 Stats Page Searching State
- When opening a stats page, a searching state is shown while the system resolves the slug:
  - Title: "📊 Searching the Project page"
  - Message: "We are preparing the statistics page you're looking for."
- Prevents the premature "Project Not Found" message before data resolves.

---

## [v3.4.0] — 2025-09-08T10:19:38.000Z

- Admin page still supports per-block previews for editing blocks.

---

## [v3.1.0] — 2025-09-08T09:14:45.000Z

### 🎯 Chart Visibility Fine-Tune

- Logic tightened in UnifiedDataVisualization: a chart is valid only if it has numeric elements and their sum > 0.

---

## [v3.0.0] — 2025-09-08T08:56:24.000Z

## [v2.18.0] — 2025-09-08T08:36:36.000Z

### 📄 CSV Export (Two-Column Table)
- All CSV exports on stats, filter, and hashtag pages now produce a two-column table with headers:
  - Variable, Value
- Each variable is a separate row:
  - Stats page: Event metadata (Event Name, Event Date, Created At, Updated At) + every project.stats field
  - Filter page: Filter Tags, Projects Matched, Date Range (Oldest/Newest/Formatted) + every project.stats field
  - Hashtag page: Hashtag, Projects Matched, Date Range (Oldest/Newest/Formatted) + every project.stats field
- Values are safely CSV-escaped and quoted.

## [v2.15.1] — 2025-09-07T17:16:38.000Z

### 📐 Visualization Parity & Chart Sizing
- Stats pages (/stats, /filter, /hashtag) now render charts with exactly the same grid, sizing, and behavior as configured in Admin Visualization.
- Desktop uses per-block gridColumns (as configured in admin), capped by global desktop units.
- Tablet/Mobile use global grid units with span clamping so widths greater than available units are gracefully limited to fit.
- Introduced per-block, id-scoped grid classes (udv-grid-[blockId]) with injected CSS to ensure specificity and avoid legacy overrides.
- Removed pixel-based min/max-width constraints for chart containers and legends so unit-based grid math is authoritative.

### 🛠 Technical
- Updated components/UnifiedDataVisualization.tsx to:
  - Apply per-block desktop columns (min 1, max block.gridColumns, capped by global desktop units).
  - Respect global tablet/mobile units and clamp chart spans accordingly.
  - Inject responsive CSS per block with !important flags where needed to neutralize legacy CSS.
  - Clamp chart width spans based on the current breakpoint’s unit count.
- Admin Visualization global preview continues to use the same shared component for exact parity.
