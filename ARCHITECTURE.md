# Sports Counter - System Architecture

## System Overview
Sports Counter is built as a modern web application using Next.js 14 with the App Router architecture. The application follows a component-based architecture with TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Component Structure

### Core Components
```
app/
├── layout.tsx        # Root layout with global styles and providers
├── page.tsx         # Home page component
└── globals.css      # Global CSS styles
```

### Planned Component Organization
```
app/
├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   ├── counter/    # Counter-related components
│   ├── sports/     # Sports selection and management
│   └── common/     # Shared UI elements
├── lib/            # Utility functions and helpers
└── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Key Technologies

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Static typing and enhanced developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency

### Development Tools
- **npm**: Package management
- **Git**: Version control
- **ESLint**: Code linting and style enforcement

## Design Principles
1. **Component Isolation**: Each component should be self-contained with clear interfaces
2. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript usage throughout the application
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS
4. **Performance**: Leverage Next.js optimizations for fast loading and rendering
5. **Visual Consistency**: Maintain clean, modern aesthetics with flat design principles

## Component Styling Conventions
1. **Card Components**:
   - No rounded corners for a cleaner, more professional appearance
   - Optimized width and spacing for improved content density
   - Consistent padding and margin ratios
2. **Button Elements**:
   - Width matched to parent container
   - Centered text alignment
   - Square corners to match card aesthetic
3. **Typography**:
   - Centered headings within cards
   - Clear visual hierarchy in text elements

## State Management
- Local component state for isolated functionality
- React Context for shared state (planned)
- Server components for data fetching

## Build and Deploy
- Development server: `npm run dev`
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Production server: `npm run start`

## Future Considerations
- Data persistence layer
- Real-time updates
- Authentication system
- API integration
