# 🧾 Test Plan – executionLog.json

## Description
Tests whether AutoAIController correctly writes execution logs with full detail, including:
- command
- output / error
- success status
- ISO timestamp

---

## ✅ Positive Cases

- [ ] After running a valid command (`echo test`), log file should contain correct output and timestamp
- [ ] After invalid command, log should contain `error` and `success: false`
- [ ] Final JSON must be valid and pretty-printed

---

## ❌ Failure Cases

- [ ] If file cannot be written (e.g. permission error), system should throw a clear error
- [ ] Empty command array → no log file should be created

---

## 📂 Output File

- Location: `executionLog.json`
- Format: JSON array with entries

---

## 🧪 Associated Module

- `src/AutoAIController.js`
