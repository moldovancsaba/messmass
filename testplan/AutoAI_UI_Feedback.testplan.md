# 🖥️ Test Plan – Auto AI Execution Feedback in UI

## Description
Specifies how the results of Auto AI command execution (`executionLog.json`) should be visualised in the renderer.

---

## ✅ Expected UI Behavior

- [ ] When execution ends, UI should show a summary: ✅ X succeeded, ❌ Y failed
- [ ] Each step result (command + success/failure) should be shown in order
- [ ] Error outputs should be visibly different (e.g. red icon or highlight)
- [ ] Final "All tasks complete" indicator should appear

---

## 🧾 Advanced (Optional)

- [ ] Allow user to expand/collapse each command output
- [ ] Download full executionLog.json
- [ ] Link each step to source (e.g. which AI reply issued it)
