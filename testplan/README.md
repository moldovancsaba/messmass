# 📋 messmass Test Plans

This directory contains all test plan documents for project modules.  
Each `.testplan.md` describes expected behaviour, edge cases, failure handling, and maps to automated tests.

---

## 📁 Structure

- `execCommand.testplan.md` – tests for `src/execCommand.js`
- More to follow as modules grow

---

## 🧪 Usage

Before implementing any new feature:
1. Write its `.testplan.md`
2. Implement tests (`test/`)
3. Only then write the implementation (TDD)
