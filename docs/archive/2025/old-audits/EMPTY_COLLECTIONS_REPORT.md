**Mode:** Dry Run

## Summary

- **Total Empty Collections Found:** 3
- **Collections Dropped:** 0
- **Collections Reserved:** 3
- **Status:** 📝 Dry Run - No Changes

## Overview

This report documents the cleanup of empty collections from the MessMass database.

### Cleanup Strategy

1. **Identify** all collections with 0 documents
2. **Search** codebase for any references to empty collections
3. **Drop** unreferenced empty collections (safe to remove)
4. **Keep** referenced empty collections (reserved for future use)

## Collections Dropped

None - all empty collections are referenced or already cleaned up.


## Collections Reserved (Not Dropped)


### 1. `event_comparisons`

- **Code References:** 1
- **Reason:** Referenced in 1 file(s) - reserved for future use
- **Action:** Kept (reserved for future use)
- **Recommendation:** Document purpose in ARCHITECTURE.md or remove code references and re-run cleanup


### 2. `partner_analytics`

- **Code References:** 3
- **Reason:** Referenced in 3 file(s) - reserved for future use
- **Action:** Kept (reserved for future use)
- **Recommendation:** Document purpose in ARCHITECTURE.md or remove code references and re-run cleanup


### 3. `charts`

- **Code References:** 1
- **Reason:** Referenced in 1 file(s) - reserved for future use
- **Action:** Kept (reserved for future use)
- **Recommendation:** Document purpose in ARCHITECTURE.md or remove code references and re-run cleanup


## Database Impact

### Before Cleanup
- Total empty collections: 3
- Database overhead from unused collections

### After Cleanup
- Empty collections removed: 0
- Reserved empty collections: 3
- Cleaner database structure
- Easier maintenance and understanding

## Recommendations


### Reserved Collections Action Items

For each reserved collection:

1. **Document Purpose**: Add to ARCHITECTURE.md explaining why it exists
2. **Implement Feature**: If planned, prioritize implementation
3. **Remove if Unused**: If no longer needed, remove code references and re-run cleanup


## Prevention Strategy

To avoid empty collection accumulation in the future:

1. **Before Creating Collections:**
   - Document purpose in ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Ensure feature implementation is complete
   - Don't create collections "just in case"

2. **Regular Audits:**
   - Run this cleanup script quarterly
   - Review collection purposes annually
   - Remove unused features completely (code + database)

3. **Development Workflow:**
   - Use migrations for schema changes
   - Test on development databases first
   - Clean up after failed experiments
