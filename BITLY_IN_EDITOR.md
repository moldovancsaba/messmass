### How to Use:

1. Open https://www.messmass.com/admin/projects
2. Click "✏️ Edit" on any event
3. Scroll down to the **"🔗 Bitly Links"** section (at the bottom, before hashtags)
4. Click **"+ Add Link"**
5. Paste your Bitly URL (e.g., `bit.ly/abc123` or `https://bit.ly/abc123`)
6. Click **"Add"**
7. Done! Link is now connected to this event ✅

### What You'll See:

- **Link titles** from Bitly
- **Remove button** (✕) to unassign a link

### Features:

✅ **Add links** without leaving the editor  
✅ **View click statistics** inline  
✅ **Remove links** from events easily  
✅ **Auto-sync** happens every night at 3 AM  
✅ **Mobile friendly** - works on all devices

## 📍 Two Ways to Manage Links

### Option 1: From Event Editor (NEW!)
- **Best for:** Adding links while editing an event
- **Location:** `/edit/[event-slug]` → Scroll to bottom
- **Use when:** You're already working on an event

### Option 2: From Bitly Admin Page
- **Best for:** Managing all Bitly links across events
- **Location:** `/admin/bitly`
- **Use when:** You want to see all links at once

---

## 💡 Tips:

- **Links are reusable:** One link can only be on ONE event at a time
- **Unassigning is safe:** Removes link from event but keeps all data
- **Clicks update daily:** Auto-sync at 3 AM UTC, or use "Sync Now" button in admin
- **No coding needed:** Just paste, click, done!

---

## 🔄 What Happens After Adding?

1. ✅ Link is immediately associated with the event
2. ✅ System fetches initial data from Bitly
3. ✅ First full sync happens at 3 AM UTC (or click "Sync Now" in `/admin/bitly`)
4. ✅ Click counts update automatically every night
5. ✅ You can view analytics in the admin Bitly page

**That's it! Simple, clean, and integrated right into your workflow.** 🚀
