After gaining independence from the Soviet Union, the team played its first international match on October 12, 1992. The national team has participated in the qualification of every major tournament from the UEFA Euro 1996 onwards, though they are yet to qualify for the knockout stage in either a UEFA European Football Championship or a FIFA World Cup. In what was the Armenian national squad's greatest success at present, the team came in third place in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying stage, with controversial officiating preventing them from achieving second place, and hence moving on to the play-off stage.\r\n\r\nThe primary training ground is at the Technical Center-Academy of the Football Federation of Armenia in the northern Avan District of the capital Yerevan, and the team plays their home matches at the Republican Stadium.",

Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for 1951–52.\r\n\r\nRoma have won Serie A three times, in 1941–42, 1982–83 and 2000–01, as well as winning nine Coppa Italia titles and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. In European competitions, Roma won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960–61 and were runners-up in the 1983–84 European Cup and the 1990–91 UEFA Cup.\r\n\r\nFifteen players have won the FIFA World Cup while playing at Roma: Ferraris, Guaita and Masetti (1934); Donati, Monzeglio and Serantoni (1938); Bruno Conti (1982); Rudi Voller and Berthold (1990); Aldair (1994); Candela (1998); Cafu (2002); Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perrotta and Francesco Totti (2006).\r\n\r\nSince 1953, Roma have played their home matches at the Stadio Olimpico, a venue they share with city rivals Lazio. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the second-largest of its kind in Italy, with only the San Siro able to seat more. The club plan to move to a new stadium, though this is yet to start construction.\r\n\r\nThe club's home colours are Tyrian purple and gold, which gives Roma their nickname \"I Giallorossi\" (\"The Yellow and Reds\"). Their club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the founding myth of Rome.",

The club's top players from this era, Ferenc Puskás, Sándor Kocsis, József Bozsik, Zoltán Czibor, and Gyula Grosics helped the club win the Hungarian League four times during the 1950s and also formed the nucleus of the legendary Hungary national team popularly known as the Mighty Magyars.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, the club enjoyed another successful period, winning a further eight Hungarian League titles. They also won league and cup doubles in 1985 and 1989. In 1991, the club was renamed Kispest Honvéd FC and adopted its current name in 2003.\r\n\r\nWhen the club was originally formed in 1909, it also organised teams that competed in fencing, cycling, gymnastics, wrestling, athletics, boxing, and tennis. Later, the Honvéd family was extended to include a water polo team, now known as Groupama Honvéd, a 33-times basketball-champion team and a handball team that were European Champions in 1982.",

The club has spent its entire history, with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons, in the top flight of Italian football, known as Serie A since 1929–30.\r\n\r\nWith 18 officially recognised UEFA and FIFA titles, they are the fourth most successful club in the world, along with Boca Juniors, and the most successful Italian club at international level. Milan has won a joint record three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup, seven European Cup/Champions League titles (Italian record), the UEFA Super Cup a joint record five times and the Cup Winners' Cup twice. With 18 league titles, Milan is the joint-second most successful club in Serie A, along with local rivals Internazionale and behind Juventus (33). They have also won the Coppa Italia five times, and the Supercoppa Italiana seven.\r\n\r\nMilan's home games are played at San Siro, also known as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The stadium, which is shared with city rivals Internazionale, is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 80,018. Inter are considered their biggest rivals, and matches between the two teams are called Derby della Madonnina, which is one of the most followed derbies in football.\r\n\r\nThe former owner of the club was former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who owned the club for 31 years. The club is one of the wealthiest in Italian and world football. It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.",

L'esordio in massima serie nel periodo antecedente il girone unico risale al 1900.\r\n\r\nÈ la terza squadra al mondo per numero di titoli internazionali vinti (18, a pari merito con il Boca Juniors e l'Independiente e alle spalle di Real Madrid e Al-Ahly, rispettivamente a quota 27 e 20).Nella sua bacheca figurano, a livello internazionale, 7 Coppe dei Campioni/UEFA Champions League, 2 Coppe delle Coppe, 5 Supercoppe europee, 3 Coppe Intercontinentali e una Coppa del mondo per club FIFA. Se in ambito internazionale il Milan è la squadra italiana con più successi, la prima italiana ad essersi aggiudicata la Coppa dei Campioni (nel 1962-1963) e la seconda squadra europea e prima italiana per numero di finali di Coppa dei Campioni/UEFA Champions League disputate (11), in ambito italiano è il secondo club più titolato, a pari merito con l'Inter e alle spalle della Juventus (57 trofei), avendo vinto 30 trofei nazionali: 18 scudetti, 5 Coppe Italia e 7 Supercoppe italiane. Complessivamente, con 48 trofei ufficiali vinti (30 nazionali e 18 internazionali), è il secondo club italiano più titolato dietro alla Juventus (68).

Numerosi calciatori sono stati premiati durante la militanza nel club con riconoscimenti quali il Pallone d'oro (8) e il FIFA World Player (3).\r\n\r\nIl club figura al settantottesimo posto della graduatoria continentale dell'UEFA, stilata in base ai risultati ottenuti nelle competizioni UEFA per club nell'ultimo quinquennio e al quarto posto nella classifica stilata dall'IFFHS dei migliori club europei del XX secolo.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Republic of Ireland national football team (Irish: Foireann peile náisiúnta Phoblacht na hÉireann) represents Ireland in association football. It is governed by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and plays its home fixtures at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe team made their debut at the 1924 Summer Olympics, reaching the quarter-finals. Between 1924 and 1936, the team competed as the Irish Free State and from then until 1950, it was referred to by the FAI as Éire or Ireland. In 1953, FIFA decreed that for competitive matches in tournaments that both Irish teams may enter, the FAI team would be officially called the Republic of Ireland while the IFA team was to be named Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland was allowed to use the title Ireland by FIFA in the Home International Competition until it was discontinued in 1984. The Republic of Ireland was the first nation from outside the United Kingdom to defeat England at home at a fixture played at Goodison Park, Liverpool, in 1949. The team also reached the quarter-final stage of the 1964 European Nations' Cup, where they lost to the eventual winners Spain.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of Jack Charlton, the team enjoyed its most successful era, reaching their highest FIFA world ranking ever at sixth in August 1993, and qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988 in their first appearance at the UEFA European Championship, reaching the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in their first ever appearance at the finals, as well as making the last 16 at the 1994 edition. Charlton's successor Mick McCarthy lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the 2002 World Cup, making it to the last 16. Under Giovanni Trapattoni, the team narrowly lost out on qualification for the 2010 World Cup during a controversial play-off, but went on to qualify for Euro 2012.\r\n\r\nThe team failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, marking the end of Trapattoni's tenure as manager. The Republic of Ireland also fell to a record low FIFA ranking of 59th, then a record low of 70th in June 2014. For the next Euro qualifying campaign under manager Martin O'Neill, the Republic of Ireland finished third behind Germany and Poland, but went on to qualify for Euro 2016 after a 3–1 aggregate win over Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs. The Boys in Green reached the Round of 16 stage at that tournament and were knocked out by the hosts and eventual runners-up France after losing 2–1.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "Ilves (pronounced ; Finnish for \"Lynx\") is a Finnish professional ice hockey team based in Tampere. They play in the Liiga at the Tampere Deck Arena.\r\n\r\nThe match between Ilves (yellow and green) and Tappara (blue and orange) on December 3, 2021 at Nokia Arena in Tampere, Finland\r\nThe colors of Ilves, green, yellow, and black, were taken from what was then the coat of arms of the city of Tampere.\r\n\r\nWith sixteen championships, Ilves is the second most successful hockey team in the Finnish championship league, the Liiga, after their local rival Tappara. The club was founded in the spring of 1931, and it played its first game against Tampereen Palloilijat the next winter. In the late 1930s, Ilves won three Finnish championship titles as the first Tampere-based hockey team.\r\n\r\nAfter World War II, Ilves started playing its home games at the then new Koulukatu ice rink. It had another championship spree in 1945–1947 when it stayed undefeated for over four years (albeit playing only 36 games during that period).\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Ilves was for the first and so far only time relegated to the second highest level of Finnish hockey but managed to return to the top tier only one year later.\r\n\r\nThe current logo was designed by Rauno Broms in 1963. In 1965, Ilves moved, along with its local rivals Tappara and KooVee, to the new Hakametsä arena, where they played until 2021.\r\n\r\nThe last Finnish Cup competition in hockey was held in 1971. Ilves won the title and has therefore been the reigning champion since. In 1972, it also won another league championship; its 15th championship in total.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1970s, Ilves went through lean times. Finally, when Koovee, which was in no better condition, was relegated at the end of the 1979–80 season, the two clubs decided to sign an agreement of cooperation. The best players of Koovee moved to Ilves, the most notable of them being Risto Jalo.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Ilves claimed its 16th and most recent championship. Along with Risto Jalo, the key players of that team were Raimo Helminen, Mikko Mäkelä, Ville Siren, and Jukka Tammi. Repeating this success proved difficult, however, when in the following summer four players left the team to play in the NHL.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1980s, Ilves had another brief stint of moderate success when coached by Sakari Pietilä. It finished first after the regular season in 1988 but was eliminated in the first round of playoffs. The next year it came away with a bronze medal, and finally in 1990 it reached the finals, only to lose to TPS.\r\n\r\nFor most of the 1990s, the club struggled with financial problems and unclear issues concerning ownership. In sports performance, the low point was in the spring of 1995, when Ilves finished last in the SM-liiga and had to fight the lower league teams SaPKo and SaiPa for their place among the elite for the next year.\r\n\r\nIlves managed to avoid relegation and was promptly reborn as a viable championship candidate, reaching the semifinals in 1997 and the finals a year after that.\r\n\r\nThe 2000s were a fairly mediocre period in Ilves history. After their bronze medal win in 2001, Ilves lost in the first round of the playoffs in six of the next seven seasons and missing the playoffs altogether in 2003. They managed to avoid relegation in 2010, 2012 and 2013.",

The club was founded in 1907, and the team's colour is royal blue.\r\n\r\nComo were in Serie A in 2002–03; this was followed by three consecutive relegations that brought the team down in Serie C2 at the end of the 2004–05 season after having lost a playoff (2–1 on aggregate) to Novara Calcio, and being then even cancelled from Italian professional football because of bankruptcy. They were successively admitted to Serie D, the top level of non-professional football in Italy, where they spent three seasons before finally managing to win promotion back to Serie C2 in the 2007–08 season. After a further bankruptcy in 2016, a new company re-founded the club in 2017 and was admitted to Serie D from 2017 to 2018 season.",

        "strDescriptionIT": "Il Como 1907 s.r.l., noto più semplicemente come Como 1907, è una società calcistica italiana con sede nella città di Como, nell'omonima provincia lombarda. Milita nel campionato di Serie B.\r\n\r\nIl Como ha disputato 35 campionati di Serie B e 13 campionati nella massima divisione, l'ultimo dei quali nella stagione 2002-2003. Il suo miglior risultato di sempre fu il sesto posto ottenuto al termine della sua prima stagione in Serie A.[4].\r\n\r\nLa tradizione sportiva del principale sodalizio calcistico comense, la 28ª a livello nazionale secondo i criteri della FIGC, iniziò nel 1907 con la nascita del Como Foot-Ball Club. Quest’ultimo, dopo le fusioni con il Club studentesco Minerva nel 1911 e con l'Esperia nel 1926, divenne l'Associazione Calcio Comense, rinominata poi Associazione Sportiva Como nel 1936. Nel 1938, dalla fusione con l'A.S. Ardita di Rebbio, nacque la Sportiva Como, divenuta poi Associazione Calcio Como e infine Como Calcio S.p.A. nel 1970.\r\n\r\nQuest’ultima venne dichiarata fallita nel 2004 e ad essa subentrò la Calcio Como S.r.l., a sua volta dichiarata fallita nel 2016 e gestita in esercizio provvisorio fino al 2017, quando l'attività sportiva è stata rilevata all'asta dalla F.C. Como S.r.l.. Nell'estate 2017, a causa di alcune pendenze non onorate, la FIGC ha però respinto la domanda di attribuzione del titolo sportivo della vecchia società fallita alla F.C. Como S.r.l., escludendo di conseguenza il Como dai campionati professionistici;[5] la squadra è stata quindi rifondata con l'attuale denominazione, ripartendo dalla Serie D.",
