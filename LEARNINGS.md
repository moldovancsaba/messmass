#### Card Layout Optimization
The decision to remove rounded corners and optimize the card layout was driven by several key factors:

1. **Visual Consistency**
   - Flat design principles align better with modern UI trends
   - Square corners provide a more professional, structured appearance
   - Consistent visual language across all components improves user experience

2. **Space Efficiency**
   - Removal of rounded corners eliminates unnecessary padding
   - Optimized card width improves content density without sacrificing readability
   - Better utilization of screen real estate, especially on mobile devices

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Simpler geometric shapes (squares vs. rounded rectangles) reduce CSS complexity
   - Consistent spacing ratios simplify responsive layouts
   - Reduced need for complex border radius calculations in nested elements

4. **Maintenance Benefits**
   - Simplified styling rules make the codebase more maintainable
   - Fewer special cases for handling corner radiuses in nested components
   - More predictable layout behavior across different screen sizes

This refinement of the UI design demonstrates our commitment to both aesthetic excellence and practical functionality, setting a foundation for future component development.
